# selection-sort-zig
Selection sort algorithm in Zig that can handle an arbitrary number of arguments (for my own learning purposes)

Building:
```bash
% zig build-exe selection-sort.zig
```

Running:
```bash
% ./selection-sort [args]
```

Example output:
```bash
% ./selection-sort 3 8 4 5 9 2
The sorted values are: 2 3 4 5 8 9
```
